# Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS. First, I created a ***S3 bucket*** and upload the website files to it. Next, I configured the bucket for website hosting and secure it using ***IAM policies***. Next, I speeded up content delivery using AWSâ€™ content distribution network service, ***CloudFront***.

Here's the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15vQ7-utH7wBJzdAX3eDmO9ls35J5_sEQ).
