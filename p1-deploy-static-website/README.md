# Deploy Static Website on AWS

- In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS. First, I created a ***S3 bucket*** and upload the website files to it. Next, I configured the bucket for website hosting and secure it using ***IAM policies***. Next, I speeded up content delivery using AWSâ€™ content distribution network service, ***CloudFront***.

- This project is developed alongside the [Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990).
